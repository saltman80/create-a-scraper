# create-a-scraper: AppSumo Product Title Scraper

**A Chrome Extension to effortlessly scrape and export product titles from AppSumo.**

This extension helps users streamline their product research on AppSumo by allowing them to easily collect product titles by clicking on them. The collected titles can then be viewed, managed, and exported as a CSV file for offline analysis. The extension aims to simplify data collection for anyone doing AppSumo product research.

## Overview

The AppSumo Product Title Scraper is designed for users who frequently browse AppSumo and need an efficient way to gather product information. While navigating AppSumo product listings, users can simply click on product titles (or associated elements made interactive by the extension) to save them. The collected titles are stored persistently and can be viewed within the extension's popup interface. From the popup, users can export the entire list to a CSV file or clear all saved titles.

A key feature is the **Options Page**, where users can configure the CSS selectors used by the extension to identify product titles. This makes the scraper adaptable to changes in AppSumo's website structure, ensuring long-term usability.

## Features

*   **One-Click Title Saving:** Click on product titles on AppSumo pages to save them instantly.
*   **Persistent Storage:** Collected titles are stored securely within the browser using `chrome.storage.local`.
*   **Popup Interface:**
    *   View the list of currently saved titles.
    *   Export the list to a CSV file with a single click.
    *   Clear all saved titles.
    *   (Potentially) Link to the Options Page.
*   **CSV Export:** Easily export your collected product titles for use in spreadsheets or other analysis tools, handled by `csvexportutility.js`.
*   **Configurable Selectors:** An Options Page (`options/options.html`) allows users to define and save custom CSS selectors for identifying product titles, providing flexibility and resilience against website updates.
*   **Visual Feedback:** Clear visual cues on the AppSumo page (e.g., "Title Saved!") indicate when a title has been successfully saved, styled by `contentpagestyles.css`.
*   **Duplicate Handling:** Prevents duplicate title entries by default, managed by `storagemanagementutility.js`.

## Architecture

This extension is built using Manifest V3, the current standard for Chrome Extensions, and follows a modular architecture:

1.  **Content Script (`appsumocontentscript.js`, `contentpagestyles.css`):** Injected into AppSumo web pages. It retrieves configured CSS selectors (from storage), identifies product titles using these selectors (potentially with advanced logic from `refinedcontentscriptlogicfordynamicselectors.js`), modifies the DOM to make titles selectable, provides user feedback on save, and sends selected titles to the Background Script.
2.  **Background Script (Service Worker - `appsumobackgroundworker.js`):** The central controller and data manager. It listens for messages from the Content Script (to save titles) and the Popup (to retrieve titles, trigger export, or clear data). It manages storing and retrieving titles using `chrome.storage.local` via `storagemanagementutility.js` and handles CSV generation/download using `csvexportutility.js` and the `chrome.downloads` API.
3.  **Popup (`extensionpopupmarkup.html`, `extensionpopupinterface.js`, `extensionpopupstyles.css`):** The user interface accessible from the Chrome toolbar icon. It displays saved titles, and provides controls for exporting to CSV and clearing data.
4.  **Options Page (`options/options.html`, `options/options.js`, `options/options.css`):** Allows users to configure extension settings, primarily the CSS selectors for identifying product titles on AppSumo. Settings are saved using `chrome.storage.sync` or `chrome.storage.local`.

## Installation

To install and use the AppSumo Product Title Scraper locally:

1.  **Download or Clone:**
    *   Download the project files as a ZIP and extract them to a local directory.
    *   Alternatively, if this project is hosted on a Git repository, clone it: `git clone <repository-url>`
2.  **Open Chrome Extensions:**
    *   Open your Google Chrome browser.
    *   Navigate to `chrome://extensions` by typing it in the address bar and pressing Enter.
3.  **Enable Developer Mode:**
    *   In the top right corner of the Extensions page, toggle the "Developer mode" switch to the ON position.
4.  **Load Unpacked Extension:**
    *   Click the "Load unpacked" button that appears.
    *   In the file dialog, navigate to the directory where you extracted/cloned the project files.
    *   Select the root project folder (the one containing `manifest.json`).
5.  The extension icon should now appear in your Chrome toolbar.

## How to Use

1.  **Configuration (Recommended):**
    *   Access the Options Page: Right-click the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar and select "Options", or find a link within the extension's popup.
    *   Define CSS Selectors: On the Options Page, you can input and save the CSS selector(s) that accurately target product titles on AppSumo pages. This is crucial for the extension to work correctly, especially if AppSumo updates its website layout. Default selectors might be provided, or `refinedcontentscriptlogicfordynamicselectors.js` might assist.
    *   Save your settings.

2.  **Scraping Product Titles:**
    *   Navigate to an AppSumo product listing page (e.g., browse, categories, search results).
    *   The content script (`appsumocontentscript.js`) will automatically run and attempt to identify product titles based on the configured selectors.
    *   Identified titles (or elements associated with them) should become interactive (e.g., change appearance on hover, or an explicit "Save Title" button might appear next to them).
    *   Click on a product title (or its save affordance) to save it.
    *   Visual feedback (e.g., a "Title Saved!" notification) will appear on the page, confirming the action.

3.  **Managing Collected Titles (Via Popup):**
    *   Click the extension icon in the Chrome toolbar to open the popup (`extensionpopupmarkup.html`).
    *   **View Titles:** The popup will display a list of all product titles you have saved.
    *   **Export to CSV:** Click the "Export to CSV" button. The extension will generate a CSV file containing all saved titles and initiate a download via the `chrome.downloads` API.
    *   **Clear Titles:** Click the "Clear All Titles" button to remove all saved titles from the extension's storage. A confirmation might be required.

## Dependencies

*   **Google Chrome Browser:** This extension is specifically designed for Google Chrome.
*   **Chrome Extension APIs:** The extension relies on various Chrome APIs, including:
    *   `chrome.storage` (`local` and potentially `sync` for options)
    *   `chrome.scripting` (for content script management if not solely manifest-defined)
    *   `chrome.downloads` (for CSV export)
    *   `chrome.runtime` (for messaging between components)
    *   `chrome.action` (for popup and toolbar icon interactions)

No external third-party JavaScript libraries are required for the core functionality as described in the project plan.

## Important Notes

*   **CSS Selector Reliability:** The effectiveness of this extension is highly dependent on the accuracy of the CSS selectors used to identify product titles. AppSumo's website HTML structure can change, which may require users to update these selectors via the **Options Page**. The `refinedcontentscriptlogicfordynamicselectors.js` file aims to provide more robust or adaptive selection mechanisms.
*   **Error Handling:** Robust error handling should be implemented throughout the extension (e.g., in DOM interactions, storage operations, message passing, CSV export) to ensure a smooth user experience and aid in troubleshooting.
*   **Permissions:** The extension requests only necessary permissions as declared in `manifest.json` (e.g., `storage`, `activeTab`, `scripting`, `downloads`, `host_permissions` for AppSumo). Users will be prompted about these permissions upon installation.

## Future Considerations

The following are potential enhancements for future versions (currently out of scope):

*   **Internationalization (`_locales`):** Add support for multiple languages in the UI.
*   **Advanced Error Reporting:** Implement a more user-friendly or detailed error reporting mechanism.
*   **Scraping Additional Fields:** Extend functionality to scrape more data points such as price, product URL, review counts, etc. (as noted in the linked Google Doc as a potential enhancement).
*   **User-Defined CSV Filenames:** Allow users to specify the name for the exported CSV file.
*   **Cloud Sync for Titles (Optional):** Offer an option to sync collected titles across devices using `chrome.storage.sync`, keeping privacy and storage limits in mind.
*   **Ability to Edit/Delete Individual Titles:** Allow users to manage saved titles more granularly from the popup.
